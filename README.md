### Ronan pleads for 1971 state transportation bond issue
- Date: October 5, 1971
- It would fail at the ballot a month later
- $2.5bil issue would be split $1.35bil for transit and $1.15bil for highways
  - A rarity to have transit amount greater than highways, and Ronan knew it
- Ronan said new bond would be used to improve existing systems, since riders complained that 1967 bond showed little tangible benefits (spent mostly on Second Avenue Subway?)
- Fare would go to 45 or 50 cents (from 30) if bond didn't pass
  - *Isn't this mixing capital and operating expenses?*
  - *Yes*, but some capital projects were already being paid out of farebox income
  - *This was pre-capital program, so my details on all this are weak right now*

### Fare raised from $1.15 to $1.25
- Date: January 1, 1992
- Took effect at midnight, handwritten signs announced day before
  - Passengers only allowed to buy 4 tokens at old fare to prevent hoarding
  - Created new physical token to prevent use of slugs (*does this mean fakes?*)
- Peter E. Stangl was MTA chairman at the time
- MTA required by state to produce a balanced budget
  - The board voted 12-to-2 to approve this budget even though it was technically not balanced
- Faced $263mil budget defecit, fare increase lowered this to $157mil
  - To fully close the gap, the increase would have needed to be to $1.40
  - *Not sure how the $157mil ended up being found, need more sources*
  - It was discussed to transfer $90mil from relatively healthy LIRR and MNR, which was contentious because of:
    - it would represent a suburban->urban transfer (which was opposed by Republication legislators)
    - and because of transfer of capital funds to operating funds
      - Senate Transportation Committee chairman Norman Levy claimed this, but MTA officials denied this

### The Light at the End of the Subway
- Date: February 1, 1982
- Only 10 subway stations had ever been modernized (as of 1982)
- Capital plan money couldn't be used by law for hiring additional police, but it could fund crime fighting indirectly through safer station design and CCTV
- Staten Island Railroad (here called Staten Island Rapid Transit line) stations to be extended to support four-car trains from three)
- Capital plan included $260mil to replace IRT and BMT power systems
  - Failures cause trains to stall or travel slowly when power is low
- They refer to the capital plan as a "bailout"
- "Fare-box revenues must, in the end, cover most of the principle and interest on the MTA bonds. Thus, depending on how high interest rates are when the bonds are sold, a fare hike may be necessary."
- Ravitch says state reneged on a promise to pay the last installment on a fifteen-year-old Transportation Bond Issue, costing the MTA $90mil
  - *I guess this was from 1967?*
  - City's annual capital contribution also cut by Koch by $65mil (only a year after hiking it by $65mil)
- $7.9bil capital plan breakdown
  - $3.6bil from new MTA bonds
  - $800mil from Triborough bonds
  - $800mil from new state bond package "guaranteed by the promise of 35 additional years of generous transit aid from Albany"
  - $1.3bil from federal aid
  - $500mil from state aid
  - $400mil from city aid
  - $400mil from "leaseback" <-- safe harbor leasing thingy
- Ravitch says it's difficult to attract good workers when diesel mechanic working for the city gets paid 30% more than one working for the TA
- Koch appointed Ross Sandler as the "new transit watchdog"
  - *not sure what statute this resulted from*

- Date: May 18, 1999
- Was 0.45 of 1% income tax on commuters in the state who work in New York City

- Mayor Giuliani opposed, Gov. Pataki signed, week before special election for State Senate seat in Rockland/Orange counties (NW of NYC)
- City enjoyed $2b surplus at the time, Republicans intended measure to lighten tax burder on suburban residents
