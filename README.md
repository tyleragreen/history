# Timeline

## 1990s

- January 1, 1992 - Fare raised from $1.15 to $1.25
  - Took effect at midnight, handwritten signs announced day before
    - Passengers only allowed to buy 4 tokens at old fare to prevent hoarding
    - Created new physical token to prevent use of slugs (does this mean fakes?)
  - MTA required by state to produce a balanced budget
  - Faced $263mil budget defecit, fare increase lowered this to $157mil
    - To fully close the gap, the increase would have needed to be to $1.40
  - Not sure how the $157mil ended up being found NEED MORE SOURCES
    - Was discussion of transferring $90mil from healthy LIRR and MNR, contentious because of suburban->urban transfer and because of transfer of capital funds to operating funds
