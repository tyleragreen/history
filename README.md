## 1970s

- October 5, 1971 - Ronan pleads for 1971 state transportation bond issue
  - It would fail at the ballot a month later
  - $2.5bil issue would be split $1.35bil for transit and $1.15bil for highways
    - A rarity to have transit amount greater than highways, and Ronan knew it
  - Ronan said new bond would be used to improve existing systems, since riders complained that 1967 bond showed little tangible benefits (spent mostly on Second Avenue Subway?)
  - Fare would go to 45 or 50 cents (from 30) if bond didn't pass
    - *Isn't this mixing capital and operating expenses?*
    - *Yes*, but some capital projects were already being paid out of farebox income
    - *This was pre-capital program, so my details on all this are weak right now*

- April 29, 1973 - Third Avenue El closes in the Bronx
  - Last stretch to close was between Gun Hill Road and 149th St
  - Ran 12 blocks east of the IND Concourse Line
  - Replaced with buses seemingly to lower an operating defecit

## 1980s

- July 10, 1981 - NY State Legislature approves 5 taxes to provide MTA operating assistance
  - Avoided fare increase from $0.75 to $1
  - Five taxes:
    - "The gross-receipts tax on the oil companies."
    - "An increase in the state sales tax of a quarter of a cent on the dollar in the region served by the M.T.A. The tax would be computed by rounding up to the nearest whole cent for fractions of 0.5 cents or more and rounding down for fractions under 0.5 cents."
    - "A 10 percent tax on capital gains in real-estate transfers of more than $1 million within New York City."
    - "A tax based on the net income and capital of oil companies' outof-state and international operations."
    - "A corporate franchise tax of 0.75 percent on the gross returns from the in-state portion of interstate communications and commercial transport." Known as the "long lines" tax.
  - *I think these all still exist. Should annotate individually.*

  - MTA required by state to produce a balanced budget
  - Faced $263mil budget defecit, fare increase lowered this to $157mil
    - To fully close the gap, the increase would have needed to be to $1.40
  - Not sure how the $157mil ended up being found NEED MORE SOURCES
    - Was discussion of transferring $90mil from healthy LIRR and MNR, contentious because of suburban->urban transfer and because of transfer of capital funds to operating funds

  - New York Urban League and Straphanger's Campaign said they would sue MTA in federal court saying the fare increase would "violate the 1964 Civil Rights Act because it would affect the poor, blacks and Hispanic people most heavily"
    - DID THIS HAPPEN?
  - Canceled fare increase on express buses from $4 to $5, saying they wouldn't be able to compete with private buses
    - Express buses are biggest money losers in the system
