# Urban History
I'm studying urban history and these are my notes. Focus will be placed on all financial aspects, particularly those of New York City and the [Metropolitan Transportation Authority](http://www.mta.info).
### Commuter Tax Repealed

- Was 0.45 of 1% income tax on commuters in the state who work in New York City
- Would reduce city revenue by $210m (or up to $360m, if courts rule tax now discriminates against out-of-state commuters (apparently this remained at the time, NEED SOURCE FOR RESULT OF THIS))
- Mayor Giuliani opposed, Gov. Pataki signed, week before special election for State Senate seat in Rockland/Orange counties (NW of NYC)
- City enjoyed $2b surplus at the time, Republicans intended measure to lighten tax burder on suburban residents
- "The Mayor asserted that the city had a right to ask commuters to contribute to the costs of police, fire and other services."

### "The Man at the Wheel of the M.T.A." - Ravitch in New York Magazine

- "A Nelson A. Rockefeller creation, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was set up in 1968 to coordinate public transit and insulate the mayor and governor from complaints about fare increases."
- Under Ronan, fares rose from 20 cents to 35
- David L. Yunich was appointed by Malcom Wilson to succeed Ronan, and oversaw fare increases from 35 cents to 50
- Harold Fisher was appointed by Carey in 1977, saw no fare increases, but oversaw deferred maintenance programs

### The Light at the End of the Subway

- Only 10 subway stations had ever been modernized (as of 1982)
- Capital plan money couldn't be used by law for hiring additional police, but it could fund crime fighting indirectly through safer station design and CCTV
- Staten Island Railroad (here called Staten Island Rapid Transit line) stations to be extended to support four-car trains from three)
- Capital plan included $260mil to replace IRT and BMT power systems
  - Failures cause trains to stall or travel slowly when power is low
- They refer to the capital plan as a "bailout"
- "Fare-box revenues must, in the end, cover most of the principle and interest on the MTA bonds. Thus, depending on how high interest rates are when the bonds are sold, a fare hike may be necessary."
- Ravitch says state reneged on a promise to pay the last installment on a fifteen-year-old Transportation Bond Issue, costing the MTA $90mil
  - *I guess this was from 1967?*
  - City's annual capital contribution also cut by Koch by $65mil (only a year after hiking it by $65mil)
- $7.9bil capital plan breakdown
  - $3.6bil from new MTA bonds
  - $800mil from Triborough bonds
  - $800mil from new state bond package "guaranteed by the promise of 35 additional years of generous transit aid from Albany"
  - $1.3bil from federal aid
  - $500mil from state aid
  - $400mil from city aid
  - $400mil from "leaseback" <-- safe harbor leasing thingy
- Ravitch says it's difficult to attract good workers when diesel mechanic working for the city gets paid 30% more than one working for the TA
- Koch appointed Ross Sandler as the "new transit watchdog"
  - *not sure what statute this resulted from*
