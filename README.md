### "The Man at the Wheel of the M.T.A." - Ravitch in New York Magazine

- "A Nelson A. Rockefeller creation, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was set up in 1968 to coordinate public transit and insulate the mayor and governor from complaints about fare increases."
- Under Ronan, fares rose from 20 cents to 35
- David L. Yunich was appointed by Malcom Wilson to succeed Ronan, and oversaw fare increases from 35 cents to 50
- HArold Fisher was appointed by Carey in 1977, saw no fare increases, but oversaw deferred maintenance programs
- Date: February 1, 1982
