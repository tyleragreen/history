### French-American company awarded car contract, MTA floats first bonds
- New cars ordered: R68s
  - New cars would have flat stainless steel exteriors to be easy to clean graffiti off of
  - Order was $210mil, or $933k per sar
    - Previous orders from Canadian and Japanese companies were $800k per car, but for smaller cars (IRT)
  - Final assembly performed at Brooklyn Army Terminal
  - Westinghouse-Amrail is a joint venture of Westinghouse of Pittsburgh and Francorail
- NYCTA completed sale of first revenue-backed bonds
  - To be used for capital program, including the subway cars ordered
  - Sold $250mil of bonds at annual rate of 9.7%
  - Prevoius car orders from Bombardier and Kawasaki included financing from Canadian and Japanese governments because MTA did not believe they could raise money through bond market at favorable rates
  - Bonds were rated BBB+ from S&P
  - Ravitch was hoping for 14%, elated to get 9.7%
  - "The $250 million issue is the first of $1.6 billion in revenue bonds the M.T.A. plans to float. Over the 30-year life of the bonds, the debt service is expected to add less than 20 cents to the fare, Mr. Ravitch said. However, he added, if ridership or government subsidies increase, the impact on the fare could be lower."

- NYCTA planned to close the areas within 7 days without public hearings or MTA approval

  - Corporate-tax revenues were down $15mil
  - Federal aid was $25mil less than expected
- "Technically, the M.T.A. can approve fare increases without the agreement of lawmakers. The Legislature, however, controls the authority's huge capital plans, giving it strong influence." [2]

### Fare increases from 5 cents to 10 cents
- Date: July 1, 1948
- $37.5mil increase in fare revenue during last 6 months of 1948 [2]
  - But 12% drop in ridership (25.5mil less)
- Average fare paid was 9.53 cents
  - Less than the actual fare of 10 cents because a combined subway and surface line fare was 12 cents
  - Rather than 10 cents plus 7 cents
- Other interesting items:
  - Board of Transportation added 1272 staff, 940 which "were permanent under civil service"
  - 14 deoderizing and germ-killing lamps were installed in IRT stations at Times Square and Grand Central
- Historically, transit was not required to be self-supporting because a fare increase would benefit private owners of "traction securities" [3]
  - No longer relevant since city now owned system
  - "Some of the cars in use are nearly forty years old"
  - City was providing $30mil annual subsidy to keep 5-cent fare using real estate taxes
  - Committee of Fifteen contained business, real estate, and industrial representatives
    - They proposed fare of 7.5 cents (2 for 15) to produce $45mil
      - Would cover $30mil current operational deficit
      - Allow $8mil for maintenance
      - And $7mil to replace old rolling stock
      - Allow for 6% cut in tax rate
      - And increase city's borrowing power, as the transit system would be operationally self-supporting ("making the transit debt self-liquidating"), which would allow for new subway construction
- In first 28 days of 10 cent fare (a 100% increase), rapid transit revenues only rose 69.77% [4]
  - Partly due to the 12 cent transit fares with transfer sold above
  - But also the institution of 16 free transfers between divisions
- Surface lines (bus and street car) fare increased from 5 to 7 cents, but only saw 18.96% rise in revenue [4]
  - All surface fare zones eliminated in Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Queens
  - 2-cent transfer charge for Brooklyn surface lines eliminated
  - On 12 cent fare with transfer to rapid transit, surface lines only collecting share of 5 cents

### Fare increases from 50 cents to 60 cents
- Date: June 28, 1980
- Carey refused to rule out another increase
- MNR referred to as "Conrail's commuter lines north of the city"
- Sidney Schwartz, New York state's special fiscal monitor for the city, warned that fares may have to rise to 75 cents in 1981 unless "the financially troubled Transit Authority gets more aid and improves its management."
- "Long Lines Expected" on Monday morning - MetroCard would eliminate this aspect of fare increases
  - Expected the morning rush to continue through 10 A.M., rather than the usual 9 A.M.
- Ravitch, in April 1980, expected rise would need to be 75 cents [3]

  - Package expected to be supported by suburban voters because of minimal impact on them, including no commuter rail fare increases
  - 10-cent fare increase expected to provide $100mil increase in revenues
    - *wonder what this is like today*
  - Also necessary to hold 50-cent fare:
    - 25-cent toll increase to give $30mil to Transit Authority (today NYCT) and $30mil to commuter railroads
    - $56mil increase in subsidy from the city, from current $304.6mil
    - Additional $40mil "found" state budget through accounting differences

### Fare increases from 35 cents to 50 cents
- Interesting era for transit funding, with city in fiscal trouble and federal dollars for transit beginning: "In this city, so close to insolvency, little more can be expected in direct subsidy out of existing tax funds. But there is need for quick action on a new regional tax to underwrite mass transit, of the kind now under study by a state legislative committee. There is also need for more substantial financial support from Washington, now that the initial breakthrough has been made on Federal subsidy for both operating and capital costs."
- MTA ran a defecit, "even operating with more than a half-billion dollars in Federal, state and municipal subsidy"
- Article was a call for improved labor costs and work practices
- Mentions an experiment train that would have lower energy usage
  - *not sure which model this would be*

- Date: October 5, 1971
- It would fail at the ballot a month later
- $2.5bil issue would be split $1.35bil for transit and $1.15bil for highways

### Fare raised from $1.15 to $1.25
- Date: January 1, 1992
- Took effect at midnight, handwritten signs announced day before
  - Passengers only allowed to buy 4 tokens at old fare to prevent hoarding
  - Created new physical token to prevent use of slugs (*does this mean fakes?*)
- Peter E. Stangl was MTA chairman at the time
- MTA required by state to produce a balanced budget
  - The board voted 12-to-2 to approve this budget even though it was technically not balanced
- Faced $263mil budget defecit, fare increase lowered this to $157mil
  - To fully close the gap, the increase would have needed to be to $1.40
  - *Not sure how the $157mil ended up being found, need more sources*
  - It was discussed to transfer $90mil from relatively healthy LIRR and MNR, which was contentious because of:
    - it would represent a suburban->urban transfer (which was opposed by Republication legislators)
    - and because of transfer of capital funds to operating funds
      - Senate Transportation Committee chairman Norman Levy claimed this, but MTA officials denied this
      - Levy argued this transfer would be similar to 1960s and 70s, when MTA several deferred maintenance on its infrastructure
- Subway and bus farebox recovery was 61% in 1991, commuter railroads was less than 50%
- Operating deficit was caused by a sharp downturn in the local economy
