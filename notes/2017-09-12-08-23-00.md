- Took effect at midnight, handwritten signs announced day before
  - Passengers only allowed to buy 4 tokens at old fare to prevent hoarding
  - Created new physical token to prevent use of slugs (*does this mean fakes?*)
- Peter E. Stangl was MTA chairman at the time
- MTA required by state to produce a balanced budget
  - The board voted 12-to-2 to approve this budget even though it was technically not balanced
- Faced $263mil budget defecit, fare increase lowered this to $157mil
  - To fully close the gap, the increase would have needed to be to $1.40
  - *Not sure how the $157mil ended up being found, need more sources*
  - It was discussed to transfer $90mil from relatively healthy LIRR and MNR, which was contentious because of:
    - it would represent a suburban->urban transfer (which was opposed by Republication legislators)
    - and because of transfer of capital funds to operating funds
      - Senate Transportation Committee chairman Norman Levy claimed this, but MTA officials denied this
      - Levy argued this transfer would be similar to 1960s and 70s, when MTA several deferred maintenance on its infrastructure
- Subway and bus farebox recovery was 61% in 1991, commuter railroads was less than 50%
- Operating deficit was caused by a sharp downturn in the local economy
