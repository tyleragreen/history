- Took effect at midnight, handwritten signs announced day before
  - Passengers only allowed to buy 4 tokens at old fare to prevent hoarding
  - Created new physical token to prevent use of slugs (does this mean fakes?)
- MTA required by state to produce a balanced budget
- Faced $263mil budget defecit, fare increase lowered this to $157mil
  - To fully close the gap, the increase would have needed to be to $1.40
- Not sure how the $157mil ended up being found NEED MORE SOURCES
  - Was discussion of transferring $90mil from healthy LIRR and MNR, contentious because of suburban->urban transfer and because of transfer of capital funds to operating funds
