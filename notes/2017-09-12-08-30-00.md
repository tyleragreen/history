- It would fail at the ballot a month later
- $2.5bil issue would be split $1.35bil for transit and $1.15bil for highways
  - A rarity to have transit amount greater than highways, and Ronan knew it
- Ronan said new bond would be used to improve existing systems, since riders complained that 1967 bond showed little tangible benefits (spent mostly on Second Avenue Subway?)
- Fare would go to 45 or 50 cents (from 30) if bond didn't pass
  - *Isn't this mixing capital and operating expenses?*
  - *Yes*, but some capital projects were already being paid out of farebox income
  - *This was pre-capital program, so my details on all this are weak right now*
