- To take effect on November 12
  - Added week cost $5.3mil
  - New token introduced to prevent hoarding, last before MetroCard
- 20% increases had been avoided since 1984 by Govenor or Mayor eventually providing more funds
- E. Virgil Conway was MTA chair at the time
- New York Urban League and Straphanger's Campaign said they would sue MTA in federal court saying the fare increase would "violate the 1964 Civil Rights Act because it would affect the poor, blacks and Hispanic people most heavily"
  - DID THIS HAPPEN?
- Canceled fare increase on express buses from $4 to $5, saying they wouldn't be able to compete with private buses
  - Express buses are biggest money losers in the system
