- Interesting era for transit funding, with city in fiscal trouble and federal dollars for transit beginning: "In this city, so close to insolvency, little more can be expected in direct subsidy out of existing tax funds. But there is need for quick action on a new regional tax to underwrite mass transit, of the kind now under study by a state legislative committee. There is also need for more substantial financial support from Washington, now that the initial breakthrough has been made on Federal subsidy for both operating and capital costs."
- MTA ran a defecit, "even operating with more than a half-billion dollars in Federal, state and municipal subsidy"
- Article was a call for improved labor costs and work practices
- Mentions an experiment train that would have lower energy usage
  - *not sure which model this would be*
