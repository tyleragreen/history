- Increases scheduled to occur every two years as part of the "authority's long-term revenue plans"
- Using borrowing to close capital gap could increase pressure to raise fares faster than scheduled
  - *This implies to me that debt service increases aren't scheduled, why not?*
- Bonus for pay-per-ride MetroCards increased from 5% to 11%
- Board chose base fare increase against keeping base fare constant and eliminating the bonus
  - Bonus kept because advocates serves as important discount for riders who cannot afford weekly or monthly passes
  - *Fare capping would also work*
- Prendergast said increase needed to "balance budget agains the rising costs of providing services"
- Increase expected to generate $210mil in 2015
- Plan to unveil new fare payment system in 2020 and remove MetroCards by end of 2022
