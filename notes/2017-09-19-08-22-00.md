- Increases scheduled to occur every two years as part of the "authority's long-term revenue plans"
- Using borrowing to close capital gap could increase pressure to raise fares faster than scheduled
  - *This implies to me that debt service increases aren't scheduled, why not?*
- Bonus for pay-per-ride MetroCards increased from 5% to 11%
- Board chose base fare increase against keeping base fare constant and eliminating the bonus
  - Bonus kept because advocates serves as important discount for riders who cannot afford weekly or monthly passes
  - *Fare capping would also work*
- Prendergast said increase needed to "balance budget agains the rising costs of providing services"
- Increase expected to generate $210mil in 2015
- Plan to unveil new fare payment system in 2020 and remove MetroCards by end of 2022
- Improved financial outlook in 2013 hinted at smaller increases for 2015 and 2017 [2]
  - Ridership and real estate revenues both up
  - "The regularly scheduled increases are part of a rescue plan approved by the State Legislature in 2009."
  - This plan reduced expected revenues by over $900mil
    - To be balanced by 3 years of "net zero" labor cost increases
