- $37.5mil increase in fare revenue during last 6 months of 1948
  - But 12% drop in ridership (25.5mil less)
- Average fare paid was 9.53 cents
  - Less than the actual fare of 10 cents because a combined subway and surface line fare was 12 cents
  - Rather than 10 cents plus 7 cents
- Other interesting items:
  - Board of Transportation added 1272 staff, 940 which "were permanent under civil service"
  - 14 deoderizing and germ-killing lamps were installed in IRT stations at Times Square and Grand Central
