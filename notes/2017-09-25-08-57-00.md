- Fifth Avenue Coach Lines, a private bus company, wanted Wagner administration to increase fare to 20 cents in 1961 [2]
  - *seems to imply NYCTA-specified fare applied to more than NYCTA*
  - 15-cent fare possible because taxpayer subsidizes all NYCTA capital costs
    - 1961 debt service was $92mil
  - City-owned NYCTA did not pay taxes, Fifth Avenue coaches paid more than $4mil annually in taxes
