; date January 2, 1984

- Kiley defends increases to make up operating deficits
- 1984 budget is $3.7bil
- New fares and tolls expected to generate $270mil
- Elderly and handicapped returned to half fare 24 hours a day
  - Had been half fare only outside of 7am and 9am
- City Council President Carol Bellamy had several criticisms
  - Questioned whether $38mil reserve fund for track work was necessary
  - Thought some operating budget items should actually be capital budget items
  - Thought budget was too conservative in "failing to count on receiving certain Federal financing"
