- Rockefeller also announced modernization plans, pending legislative approval of the bond authority
  - *not sure what bond authority is here*
- Purchase of 80 new Penn Central cars finances with $21mil in bonds through New York State Commuter Car Program
  - NYS CCP administered by Port Authority, which was then still called the Port of New York Authority
  - Port Authority would buy cars and lease them to the state
- Rest of modernization financed by $44mil in bonds from State Transportation Bond Fund
- Ronan said Penn Central would manage the line under MTA's direction, and MTA would pay them for maintenance and oprating costs, which would be paid out of operating revenue
