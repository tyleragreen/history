- NYCTA planned to close the areas within 7 days without public hearings or MTA approval
- "For January of this year, subway crime declined by more than 20 percent. The transit police say the number dropped because of a crackdown on fare dvasion that prevented people who would commit more serious crimes from entering the subway."
  - Bratton had become transit police chief in 1990!
- Woman was raped on March 20 in tunnel beneath Avenue of the Americas to connect 34th and 42nd St stations
- Some sections closed were paths between uptown and downtown at local stations
  - *Did this lead to some of the "Downtown Only" stations we have today?*
  - TA said paths at express stations would not be closed
