### French-American company awarded car contract, MTA floats first bonds
- New cars ordered: R68s
  - New cars would have flat stainless steel exteriors to be easy to clean graffiti off of
  - Order was $210mil, or $933k per sar
    - Previous orders from Canadian and Japanese companies were $800k per car, but for smaller cars (IRT)
  - Final assembly performed at Brooklyn Army Terminal
  - Westinghouse-Amrail is a joint venture of Westinghouse of Pittsburgh and Francorail
- NYCTA completed sale of first revenue-backed bonds
  - To be used for capital program, including the subway cars ordered
  - Sold $250mil of bonds at annual rate of 9.7%
  - Prevoius car orders from Bombardier and Kawasaki included financing from Canadian and Japanese governments because MTA did not believe they could raise money through bond market at favorable rates

  - "The $250 million issue is the first of $1.6 billion in revenue bonds the M.T.A. plans to float. Over the 30-year life of the bonds, the debt service is expected to add less than 20 cents to the fare, Mr. Ravitch said. However, he added, if ridership or government subsidies increase, the impact on the fare could be lower."

  - Federal aid was $25mil less than expected
- "Technically, the M.T.A. can approve fare increases without the agreement of lawmakers. The Legislature, however, controls the authority's huge capital plans, giving it strong influence." [2]

### Fare increases from 15 cents to 20 cents
- Date: July 5, 1966
- Fifth Avenue Coach Lines, a private bus company, wanted Wagner administration to increase fare to 20 cents in 1961 [2]
  - *seems to imply NYCTA-specified fare applied to more than NYCTA*
  - 15-cent fare possible because taxpayer subsidizes all NYCTA capital costs
    - 1961 debt service was $92mil
  - City-owned NYCTA did not pay taxes, Fifth Avenue coaches paid more than $4mil annually in taxes
- Lindsay asked for $520mil tax package from Albany, but did not get it all
- Senate killed a bill that would allow the city to transfer $69mil in state aid to NYCTA
  - The state aid was $100mil from January 1966 to lessen the burden of settling the 1966 transit strike
  - Without being able to use this aid, fare rose 5 cents

### Fare increases from 5 cents to 10 cents
- Date: July 1, 1948
- $37.5mil increase in fare revenue during last 6 months of 1948 [2]
  - But 12% drop in ridership (25.5mil less)
- Average fare paid was 9.53 cents
  - Less than the actual fare of 10 cents because a combined subway and surface line fare was 12 cents
  - Rather than 10 cents plus 7 cents
- Other interesting items:
  - Board of Transportation added 1272 staff, 940 which "were permanent under civil service"
  - 14 deoderizing and germ-killing lamps were installed in IRT stations at Times Square and Grand Central
- Historically, transit was not required to be self-supporting because a fare increase would benefit private owners of "traction securities" [3]
  - No longer relevant since city now owned system
  - "Some of the cars in use are nearly forty years old"
  - City was providing $30mil annual subsidy to keep 5-cent fare using real estate taxes
  - Committee of Fifteen contained business, real estate, and industrial representatives
    - They proposed fare of 7.5 cents (2 for 15) to produce $45mil
      - Would cover $30mil current operational deficit
      - Allow $8mil for maintenance
      - And $7mil to replace old rolling stock
      - Allow for 6% cut in tax rate
      - And increase city's borrowing power, as the transit system would be operationally self-supporting ("making the transit debt self-liquidating"), which would allow for new subway construction
- In first 28 days of 10 cent fare (a 100% increase), rapid transit revenues only rose 69.77% [4]
  - Partly due to the 12 cent transit fares with transfer sold above
  - But also the institution of 16 free transfers between divisions
- Surface lines (bus and street car) fare increased from 5 to 7 cents, but only saw 18.96% rise in revenue [4]
  - All surface fare zones eliminated in Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Queens
  - 2-cent transfer charge for Brooklyn surface lines eliminated
  - On 12 cent fare with transfer to rapid transit, surface lines only collecting share of 5 cents
    - *seems like an internal NYCTA policy*

- Date: March 22, 2015

- Using borrowing to close capital gap could increase pressure to raise fares faster than scheduled
  - *This implies to me that debt service increases aren't scheduled, why not?*
- Bonus for pay-per-ride MetroCards increased from 5% to 11%
- Board chose base fare increase against keeping base fare constant and eliminating the bonus
  - Bonus kept because advocates serves as important discount for riders who cannot afford weekly or monthly passes
  - *Fare capping would also work*
- Prendergast said increase needed to "balance budget agains the rising costs of providing services"
- Increase expected to generate $210mil in 2015
- Plan to unveil new fare payment system in 2020 and remove MetroCards by end of 2022
- Improved financial outlook in 2013 hinted at smaller increases for 2015 and 2017 [2]

  - Package expected to be supported by suburban voters because of minimal impact on them, including no commuter rail fare increases
  - 10-cent fare increase expected to provide $100mil increase in revenues
    - *wonder what this is like today*

    - $56mil increase in subsidy from the city, from current $304.6mil
    - Additional $40mil "found" state budget through accounting differences

### Fare increases from 35 cents to 50 cents
- Interesting era for transit funding, with city in fiscal trouble and federal dollars for transit beginning: "In this city, so close to insolvency, little more can be expected in direct subsidy out of existing tax funds. But there is need for quick action on a new regional tax to underwrite mass transit, of the kind now under study by a state legislative committee. There is also need for more substantial financial support from Washington, now that the initial breakthrough has been made on Federal subsidy for both operating and capital costs."
- MTA ran a defecit, "even operating with more than a half-billion dollars in Federal, state and municipal subsidy"
- Article was a call for improved labor costs and work practices
- Mentions an experiment train that would have lower energy usage
  - *not sure which model this would be*

### Ronan pleads for 1971 state transportation bond issue
- Date: October 5, 1971
- It would fail at the ballot a month later
- $2.5bil issue would be split $1.35bil for transit and $1.15bil for highways
  - A rarity to have transit amount greater than highways, and Ronan knew it
- Ronan said new bond would be used to improve existing systems, since riders complained that 1967 bond showed little tangible benefits (spent mostly on Second Avenue Subway?)
- Fare would go to 45 or 50 cents (from 30) if bond didn't pass
  - *Isn't this mixing capital and operating expenses?*
  - *Yes*, but some capital projects were already being paid out of farebox income
  - *This was pre-capital program, so my details on all this are weak right now*

### Fare raised from $1.15 to $1.25
- Date: January 1, 1992
- Took effect at midnight, handwritten signs announced day before
  - Passengers only allowed to buy 4 tokens at old fare to prevent hoarding
  - Created new physical token to prevent use of slugs (*does this mean fakes?*)
- Peter E. Stangl was MTA chairman at the time
- MTA required by state to produce a balanced budget
  - The board voted 12-to-2 to approve this budget even though it was technically not balanced
- Faced $263mil budget defecit, fare increase lowered this to $157mil
  - To fully close the gap, the increase would have needed to be to $1.40
  - *Not sure how the $157mil ended up being found, need more sources*
  - It was discussed to transfer $90mil from relatively healthy LIRR and MNR, which was contentious because of:
    - it would represent a suburban->urban transfer (which was opposed by Republication legislators)
    - and because of transfer of capital funds to operating funds
      - Senate Transportation Committee chairman Norman Levy claimed this, but MTA officials denied this
      - Levy argued this transfer would be similar to 1960s and 70s, when MTA several deferred maintenance on its infrastructure
- Subway and bus farebox recovery was 61% in 1991, commuter railroads was less than 50%
- Operating deficit was caused by a sharp downturn in the local economy
