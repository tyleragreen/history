### First air-conditioned subway cars
- Trial run of 4 cars (in a 10-car train) on the F train
  - From 179th in Jamaica to Lafayette Street in Manhattan
  - _Did the F stop at Broadway Lafayette?_
- System had total of 4k cars
- Lindsay hoped cars would decrease hostility index
- Lindsay wanted to order 200 more cars for 1969 if trial was a success
- Cost expected to be $165k, compared to $125k for non-air conditioned car
- Walter Schlager was general manager of NYCTA
  - Said air-conditioned subway train required about 1/3 more power than conventional train
  - Would require new substations to provide additional power
