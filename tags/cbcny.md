### CBCNY report on maintaining useful life of subway cars
- 2008 budget cuts extended car rehab cycles from every 6 and 12 year periods to every 7 and 14 years
  - Resulted in 150 fewer cars rehabilitated annually
- Another 2008 cut resulted in inspection cycles for all but 2 oldest car models being increased from every 11k miles (~71 days) to 12k miles (~78 days)
