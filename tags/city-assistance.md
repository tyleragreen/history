  - Federal operating assistance formula revised in 1978 to give weight to cities with greater than 750k people and rail systems
  - Federal operating assistance totaled $1.0939bil in 1980, 30.2% of government aid
    - State assistance was $820.4mil, local assistance was $1.7039bil
  - Ravitch says fares cover 55% of MTA's $2.5bil operating budget (all modes)
