### Wassaic and Tenmile River Stations Open on Metro-North Harlem Line
- First expansion since Metro-North began operation in 1983
- "Business is booming so much that Metro-North has considered building an extension into Pennsylvania Station and rehabilitating an old east-west line, which would run from Beacon in Dutchess County to the Brewster station in Putnam."
- "'We've always viewed the train as our connection to the metropolitan area,' she said. 'I feel like it keeps us connected to life and activity, so we're not just forgotten out here.'"
