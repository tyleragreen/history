### Board votes to increase fare to $1.50, a 20% increase

- To take effect on November 12
  - Added week cost $5.3mil
  - New token introduced to prevent hoarding, last before MetroCard
- 20% increases had been avoided since 1984 by Govenor or Mayor eventually providing more funds
- E. Virgil Conway was MTA chair at the time
- New York Urban League and Straphanger's Campaign said they would sue MTA in federal court saying the fare increase would "violate the 1964 Civil Rights Act because it would affect the poor, blacks and Hispanic people most heavily"
  - DID THIS HAPPEN?
- Canceled fare increase on express buses from $4 to $5, saying they wouldn't be able to compete with private buses
  - Express buses are biggest money losers in the system
- Date: October 20, 1995

### Fare raised from $1.15 to $1.25

- Took effect at midnight, handwritten signs announced day before
  - Passengers only allowed to buy 4 tokens at old fare to prevent hoarding
  - Created new physical token to prevent use of slugs (does this mean fakes?)
- MTA required by state to produce a balanced budget
- Faced $263mil budget defecit, fare increase lowered this to $157mil
  - To fully close the gap, the increase would have needed to be to $1.40
- Not sure how the $157mil ended up being found NEED MORE SOURCES
  - Was discussion of transferring $90mil from healthy LIRR and MNR, contentious because of suburban->urban transfer and because of transfer of capital funds to operating funds
- Date: January 1, 1992
