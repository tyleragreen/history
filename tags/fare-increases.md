  - Federal aid was $25mil less than expected
- "Technically, the M.T.A. can approve fare increases without the agreement of lawmakers. The Legislature, however, controls the authority's huge capital plans, giving it strong influence." [2]

### Fare increases from 5 cents to 10 cents
- Date: July 1, 1948
- $37.5mil increase in fare revenue during last 6 months of 1948 [2]
  - But 12% drop in ridership (25.5mil less)
- Average fare paid was 9.53 cents
  - Less than the actual fare of 10 cents because a combined subway and surface line fare was 12 cents
  - Rather than 10 cents plus 7 cents
- Other interesting items:
  - Board of Transportation added 1272 staff, 940 which "were permanent under civil service"
  - 14 deoderizing and germ-killing lamps were installed in IRT stations at Times Square and Grand Central
- Historically, transit was not required to be self-supporting because a fare increase would benefit private owners of "traction securities" [3]
  - No longer relevant since city now owned system
  - "Some of the cars in use are nearly forty years old"
  - City was providing $30mil annual subsidy to keep 5-cent fare using real estate taxes
  - Committee of Fifteen contained business, real estate, and industrial representatives
    - They proposed fare of 7.5 cents (2 for 15) to produce $45mil
      - Would cover $30mil current operational deficit
      - Allow $8mil for maintenance
      - And $7mil to replace old rolling stock
      - Allow for 6% cut in tax rate
      - And increase city's borrowing power, as the transit system would be operationally self-supporting ("making the transit debt self-liquidating"), which would allow for new subway construction
- In first 28 days of 10 cent fare (a 100% increase), rapid transit revenues only rose 69.77% [4]
  - Partly due to the 12 cent transit fares with transfer sold above
  - But also the institution of 16 free transfers between divisions
- Surface lines (bus and street car) fare increased from 5 to 7 cents, but only saw 18.96% rise in revenue [4]
  - All surface fare zones eliminated in Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Queens
  - 2-cent transfer charge for Brooklyn surface lines eliminated
  - On 12 cent fare with transfer to rapid transit, surface lines only collecting share of 5 cents
    - *seems like an internal NYCTA policy*

### Fare increases from 35 cents to 50 cents
- Interesting era for transit funding, with city in fiscal trouble and federal dollars for transit beginning: "In this city, so close to insolvency, little more can be expected in direct subsidy out of existing tax funds. But there is need for quick action on a new regional tax to underwrite mass transit, of the kind now under study by a state legislative committee. There is also need for more substantial financial support from Washington, now that the initial breakthrough has been made on Federal subsidy for both operating and capital costs."
- MTA ran a defecit, "even operating with more than a half-billion dollars in Federal, state and municipal subsidy"
- Article was a call for improved labor costs and work practices
- Mentions an experiment train that would have lower energy usage
  - *not sure which model this would be*

  - *Not sure how the $157mil ended up being found, need more sources*

    - it would represent a suburban->urban transfer (which was opposed by Republication legislators)
    - and because of transfer of capital funds to operating funds
      - Senate Transportation Committee chairman Norman Levy claimed this, but MTA officials denied this
