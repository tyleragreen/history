### Fare increases from 90 cents to $1
- Date: January 1, 1986
- Legislature saved 90-cent fare at end of 1984 by extending a corporate tax surcharge that helps subsidize mass transit in the NYC metro
- Increase came as Transit Authority faced potential $225mil operating defecit for 1986
  - *When did they stop calling themselves the Transit Authority?*
- Koch wanted to keep 90-cent fare for another year through a state increase of tax on real estate transactions greater than $1mil in the city
- Cuomo said keeping 90-cent fare was not in his priorities, and wanted the legislature to focus on medical malpractice insurance
  - Koch responded, "I mean, you have to be able to do more than chew gum."
