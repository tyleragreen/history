### Wassaic and Tenmile River Stations Open on Metro-North Harlem Line
- First expansion since Metro-North began operation in 1983
- "Business is booming so much that Metro-North has considered building an extension into Pennsylvania Station and rehabilitating an old east-west line, which would run from Beacon in Dutchess County to the Brewster station in Putnam."
- "'We've always viewed the train as our connection to the metropolitan area,' she said. 'I feel like it keeps us connected to life and activity, so we're not just forgotten out here.'"

### Rockefeller proposes state take over Harlem and Hudson lines
- Rockefeller also announced modernization plans, pending legislative approval of the bond authority
  - *not sure what bond authority is here*
- Purchase of 80 new Penn Central cars finances with $21mil in bonds through New York State Commuter Car Program
  - NYS CCP administered by Port Authority, which was then still called the Port of New York Authority
  - Port Authority would buy cars and lease them to the state
- Rest of modernization financed by $44mil in bonds from State Transportation Bond Fund
- Ronan said Penn Central would manage the line under MTA's direction, and MTA would pay them for maintenance and oprating costs, which would be paid out of operating revenue
- Plans for take-over started with state transit master plan in 1968
