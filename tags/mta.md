### Ronan pleads for 1971 state transportation bond issue

- It would fail at the ballot a month later
- $2.5bil issue would be split $1.35bil for transit and $1.15bil for highways
  - A rarity to have transit amount greater than highways, and Ronan knew it
- Ronan said new bond would be used to improve existing systems, since riders complained that 1967 bond showed little tangible benefits (spent mostly on Second Avenue Subway?)
- Fare would go to 45 or 50 cents (from 30) if bond didn't pass
  - *Isn't this mixing capital and operating expenses?*
  - *Yes*, but some capital projects were already being paid out of farebox income
  - *This was pre-capital program, so my details on all this are weak right now*

### The Light at the End of the Subway

- Only 10 subway stations had ever been modernized (as of 1982)
- Capital plan money couldn't be used by law for hiring additional police, but it could fund crime fighting indirectly through safer station design and CCTV
- Staten Island Railroad (here called Staten Island Rapid Transit line) stations to be extended to support four-car trains from three)

  - Failures cause trains to stall or travel slowly when power is low
- They refer to the capital plan as a "bailout"
- "Fare-box revenues must, in the end, cover most of the principle and interest on the MTA bonds. Thus, depending on how high interest rates are when the bonds are sold, a fare hike may be necessary."

  - *I guess this was from 1967?*
  - City's annual capital contribution also cut by Koch by $65mil (only a year after hiking it by $65mil)
- $7.9bil capital plan breakdown
  - $3.6bil from new MTA bonds
  - $800mil from Triborough bonds
  - $800mil from new state bond package "guaranteed by the promise of 35 additional years of generous transit aid from Albany"
  - $1.3bil from federal aid
  - $500mil from state aid
  - $400mil from city aid
  - $400mil from "leaseback" <-- safe harbor leasing thingy
- Ravitch says it's difficult to attract good workers when diesel mechanic working for the city gets paid 30% more than one working for the TA
- Koch appointed Ross Sandler as the "new transit watchdog"
  - *not sure what statute this resulted from*
