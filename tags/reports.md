### Fare increases from 5 cents to 10 cents
- Date: July 1, 1948
- $37.5mil increase in fare revenue during last 6 months of 1948 [2]
  - But 12% drop in ridership (25.5mil less)
- Average fare paid was 9.53 cents
  - Less than the actual fare of 10 cents because a combined subway and surface line fare was 12 cents
  - Rather than 10 cents plus 7 cents
- Other interesting items:
  - Board of Transportation added 1272 staff, 940 which "were permanent under civil service"
  - 14 deoderizing and germ-killing lamps were installed in IRT stations at Times Square and Grand Central
- Historically, transit was not required to be self-supporting because a fare increase would benefit private owners of "traction securities" [3]
  - No longer relevant since city now owned system
  - "Some of the cars in use are nearly forty years old"
  - City was providing $30mil annual subsidy to keep 5-cent fare using real estate taxes
  - Committee of Fifteen contained business, real estate, and industrial representatives
    - They proposed fare of 7.5 cents (2 for 15) to produce $45mil
      - Would cover $30mil current operational deficit
      - Allow $8mil for maintenance
      - And $7mil to replace old rolling stock
      - Allow for 6% cut in tax rate
      - And increase city's borrowing power, as the transit system would be operationally self-supporting ("making the transit debt self-liquidating"), which would allow for new subway construction
- In first 28 days of 10 cent fare (a 100% increase), rapid transit revenues only rose 69.77% [4]
  - Partly due to the 12 cent transit fares with transfer sold above
  - But also the institution of 16 free transfers between divisions
- Surface lines (bus and street car) fare increased from 5 to 7 cents, but only saw 18.96% rise in revenue [4]
  - All surface fare zones eliminated in Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Queens
  - 2-cent transfer charge for Brooklyn surface lines eliminated
  - On 12 cent fare with transfer to rapid transit, surface lines only collecting share of 5 cents
    - *seems like an internal NYCTA policy*
