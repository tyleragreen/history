### Fare increases from $1 to $1.15
- Date: January 1, 1990
- A 1987 agreement with the unions, Governor, and Legislature "provided for the $1.15 fare" [1]
  - Occurred while approving 1987 $8.5bil capital plan
  - Written primarily by Felix Rohatyn
- Increase of 15% was to close $200mil budget defecit
- There was a political retreat from a $1.25 fare
  - Some say due to public outcry, others say it was a political gimmick
- Kiley said in July 1989 that more than a $1.15 fare may be necessary
  - Ridership had not increased, resulting in $15mil less revenue than expected
  - Corporate-tax revenues were down $15mil
  - Federal aid was $25mil less than expected
- "Technically, the M.T.A. can approve fare increases without the agreement of lawmakers. The Legislature, however, controls the authority's huge capital plans, giving it strong influence." [2]
