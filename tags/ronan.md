### Rockefeller proposes state take over Harlem and Hudson lines
- Rockefeller also announced modernization plans, pending legislative approval of the bond authority
  - *not sure what bond authority is here*
- Purchase of 80 new Penn Central cars finances with $21mil in bonds through New York State Commuter Car Program
  - NYS CCP administered by Port Authority, which was then still called the Port of New York Authority
  - Port Authority would buy cars and lease them to the state
- Rest of modernization financed by $44mil in bonds from State Transportation Bond Fund
- Ronan said Penn Central would manage the line under MTA's direction, and MTA would pay them for maintenance and oprating costs, which would be paid out of operating revenue
- Plans for take-over started with state transit master plan in 1968

### Ronan pleads for 1971 state transportation bond issue
- Date: October 5, 1971
- It would fail at the ballot a month later
- $2.5bil issue would be split $1.35bil for transit and $1.15bil for highways
  - A rarity to have transit amount greater than highways, and Ronan knew it
- Ronan said new bond would be used to improve existing systems, since riders complained that 1967 bond showed little tangible benefits (spent mostly on Second Avenue Subway?)
- Fare would go to 45 or 50 cents (from 30) if bond didn't pass
  - *Isn't this mixing capital and operating expenses?*
  - *Yes*, but some capital projects were already being paid out of farebox income
  - *This was pre-capital program, so my details on all this are weak right now*
