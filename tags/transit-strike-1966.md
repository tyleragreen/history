### Fare increases from 15 cents to 20 cents
- Date: July 5, 1966
- Fifth Avenue Coach Lines, a private bus company, wanted Wagner administration to increase fare to 20 cents in 1961 [2]
  - *seems to imply NYCTA-specified fare applied to more than NYCTA*
  - 15-cent fare possible because taxpayer subsidizes all NYCTA capital costs
    - 1961 debt service was $92mil
  - City-owned NYCTA did not pay taxes, Fifth Avenue coaches paid more than $4mil annually in taxes
- Lindsay asked for $520mil tax package from Albany, but did not get it all
- Senate killed a bill that would allow the city to transfer $69mil in state aid to NYCTA
  - The state aid was $100mil from January 1966 to lessen the burden of settling the 1966 transit strike
  - Without being able to use this aid, fare rose 5 cents
