## 1990s
**January 1, 1992** - Fare raised from $1.15 to $1.25

- Took effect at midnight, handwritten signs announced day before
  - Passengers only allowed to buy 4 tokens at old fare to prevent hoarding
  - Created new physical token to prevent use of slugs (*does this mean fakes?*)
- Peter E. Stangl was MTA chairman at the time
- MTA required by state to produce a balanced budget
  - The board voted 12-to-2 to approve this budget even though it was technically not balanced
- Faced $263mil budget defecit, fare increase lowered this to $157mil
  - To fully close the gap, the increase would have needed to be to $1.40
  - *Not sure how the $157mil ended up being found, need more sources*
  - It was discussed to transfer $90mil from relatively healthy LIRR and MNR, which was contentious because of:
    - it would represent a suburban->urban transfer (which was opposed by Republication legislators)
    - and because of transfer of capital funds to operating funds
      - Senate Transportation Committee chairman Norman Levy claimed this, but MTA officials denied this

**November 12, 1995** - Fare increases from $1.25 to $1.50

- Board voted to increase fare to $1.50 on October 19, 1995, a 20% increase
- To take effect on November 12
  - One week delay cost the MTA $5.3mil
  - New token introduced to prevent hoarding, last before MetroCard
- 20% increases had been avoided since 1984 by Govenor or Mayor eventually providing more funds
- E. Virgil Conway was MTA chair at the time
- New York Urban League and Straphanger's Campaign said they would sue MTA in federal court saying the fare increase would "violate the 1964 Civil Rights Act because it would affect the poor, blacks and Hispanic people most heavily"
  - DID THIS HAPPEN?
- Canceled fare increase on express buses from $4 to $5, saying they wouldn't be able to compete with private buses
  - Express buses are biggest money losers in the system
