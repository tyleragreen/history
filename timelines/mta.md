### The Light at the End of the Subway

- Only 10 subway stations had ever been modernized (as of 1982)
- Capital plan money couldn't be used by law for hiring additional police, but it could fund crime fighting indirectly through safer station design and CCTV
- Staten Island Railroad (here called Staten Island Rapid Transit line) stations to be extended to support four-car trains from three)
- Capital plan included $260mil to replace IRT and BMT power systems
  - Failures cause trains to stall or travel slowly when power is low
- They refer to the capital plan as a "bailout"
- "Fare-box revenues must, in the end, cover most of the principle and interest on the MTA bonds. Thus, depending on how high interest rates are when the bonds are sold, a fare hike may be necessary."
- Ravitch says state reneged on a promise to pay the last installment on a fifteen-year-old Transportation Bond Issue, costing the MTA $90mil
  - *I guess this was from 1967?*
  - City's annual capital contribution also cut by Koch by $65mil (only a year after hiking it by $65mil)
- $7.9bil capital plan breakdown
  - $3.6bil from new MTA bonds
  - $800mil from Triborough bonds
  - $800mil from new state bond package "guaranteed by the promise of 35 additional years of generous transit aid from Albany"
  - $1.3bil from federal aid
  - $500mil from state aid
  - $400mil from city aid
  - $400mil from "leaseback" <-- safe harbor leasing thingy
- Ravitch says it's difficult to attract good workers when diesel mechanic working for the city gets paid 30% more than one working for the TA
- Koch appointed Ross Sandler as the "new transit watchdog"
  - *not sure what statute this resulted from*
- Date: February 1, 1982
